           <p><em><b>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</b></em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">I look forward to engaging with my established skills through different paradigms of thought. I want to use different sources and not just think creatively but also academically and reflectively so as to narrow down on the appropriate audience. I want my work to engage on more than just a surface level or entertainment experience</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em><b>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</b></em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">A diverse environment is catalyst for change and evolution. I am aware that the field I am pursuing is multifaceted and can require significant time dedication, something that becomes much more efficient when divided among specialists. I am eager to find people on the same path, even if only temporarily. By interacting with my classmates and exposing myself to different mindsets and goals, I hope that I may be able to adopt beneficial habits from them, or potentially find new ways to reinvent my process altogether.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em><b>3.	Think deeply about craft. </b></em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">From a young age I have always gravitated towards visual arts, whether through media or by traditional drawings on paper. It allowed me to percieve my environment as works in progress and not just as concrete objects in motion. I have also found that this can cause an often overthinking/overworking mentality on subjects that might not require such focus and may even hinder progress. By dipping into different mediums and forcing myself to move forward, I hope to preserve that deep thinking yet limit the time spent to only that which is necessary</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em><b>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </b></em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Most of my experience I feel has been through a series of trial, error, and curiosity. The structure of academia seldom stuck with me unleess it involved one or more of these aspects. It's not difficulty so much as it is a lack of mental engagement. Being so indulged in the artistic mindset, I look forward to evolving that curiosity and apply it so as to embrace any type of information and think about research more dialectically</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em><b>5. Learn to present your work</b></em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">I've seldom been inclined to present my work publicly even to those close to me. As an artist I rarely feel that any projects are "done" and therefore everything is still in progress. This could be a way of avoiding criticism; however I know that feedback is essential in establishing and understanding an audience as well as a tool to measure progress and purpose. This is a field I know I need development in and am eager to see how it develops throughout this course</p>

     <h3 class="margin">Phase 2/3 Course Goals</h3>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Entering the second phase I found more comfort and flexibility working within an area I had experience in already. I've taken multiple film classes in highschool and have had good experience behind the camera + within Adobe's Premiere Pro and After Effects programs. It was refreshing to be able to physically go out into my environment and frame it between lenses. It brought back a familiar sense of perspective that leeched into not just the project itself but within my outlook in life entirely</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Likewise in the same way that I had rediscovered a new mentality of thought, I also found great interest and influence looking through my collegue's projects and seeing each individual's different style of framing. When I found obstacles in direction or creativity, it was reinvigorating to interact with and observe the variety of work produced using the same tools. When I thought that my neighborhood was too stale or boring to film, I would find a new vantage point covered by my classmate or a new method to animate the puppets in Character Creator </p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">The programs that were familiar to me didn't present difficulty in engaging with past the surface level. Character Creator, and even After Effects to a certain degree, however had me under lapses of interest. It became difficult to immerse myself with tools I did not have complete understanding of. In these moments I found that running back to the basics through tutorials and trial/error allowed me to regroup mentally, reassess navigation, and adjust course closer towards productivity.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Research for me has always been lacking in excitement and often dull in purpose so naturally I found myself procrastinating in fullfilling those tasks. It wasn't until I read the Allegory of the Cave again that the intellectual side of my mind came to function. I thought about myself as someone entranced by moving shadows; building an environment exclusively around projected figures. I tried to apply myself more directly within discomfort and was able to find more information in visual arts through the vein of academia. There were so many applications of a skill I had previously seen as specifically entertainment used for learning, planning, teaching, etc. across various fields of work. I was able to organize more efficiently, interact with more freely, and heighten my strategy of understanding.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Repetition precedes comfort. As I continue to display and examine my techniques, skills, interests, and knowledge among my peers, friends, and family, I find myself gainig more confidence and efficiency in the act of presentation. Most especially in moments between completion where the product or progress may not be within my own scope or definition of finished </p>

         <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">In the process of finalizing my vision, I was forced to imagine a product that was more than just entertaining to look at. I wanted the user to leave the installation with something to think about; a theme that might resonate with a memory. I imagined moving images to emphasize the illusion of immersion but ultimately found it outside my scope. I decided to flesh out the narrative aspect more creatively due to time constraints</p>

      <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I came to the conclusion of design for my final project through my peers actually. I was introduced to a web narrative called "The Boat" that illustrated the story of refugees fleeing conflict through an elaborate and captivating animated website. I found other peers in my class also building their projects around visual narrative in different ways. By incorporating new perspectives and engaging socially I was better able to understand my own path and final project.</p>
